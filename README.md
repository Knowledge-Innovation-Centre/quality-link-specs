# QualityLink specifications

Repository for specifications developed within the [QualityLink project](https://quality-link.eu/).

To work on the files, install Bikeshed as explained in its [documentation](https://speced.github.io/bikeshed/#installing). In addition to what is mentioned there, it also works well with regular pip in a venv, so you can run:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install bikeshed
```

Process individual specs or run `make` to process all in the repository.
