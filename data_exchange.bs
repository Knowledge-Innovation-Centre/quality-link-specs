Abstract: This specification standardises how HEIs and other data providers can make data available for aggregation.
</pre>

Introduction {#intro}
============

<div class="informative">

Status of This Document {#status}
-----------------------

This document is a draft specification, developed by KIC and EUF within the [QualityLink](https://quality-link.eu/) project. It is currently being discussed with the QualityLink Standards Consultation Board.

Goals and Rationale {#rationale}
-------------------

The QualityLink project aims to develop a scalable architecture that allows higher education institutions and others to publish data on their learning opportunities in different interoperable formats easily. This specification describes the formats in which HEIs and other data providers can make data available for aggregation.

Audience {#audience}
--------

This specification is intended for use by higher education institutions and other data providers that would like their data to be available for aggregation.

Secondly, it targets data aggregators. The QualityLink project will implement a data aggregator to test and demonstrate this specification in practice.

Existing standards {#existing-standards}
------------------

* The European Learning Model [[ELM]] itself does not address the transport layer. The QDR uses RDF serialised as XML, which can be manually uploaded, hosted by the data provider and regularly pulled, or pushed by the data provider.

* [[Edu-API]], [[OOAPI]] and the [[OCCAPI]] define a REST API to expose the information in JSON format. Edu-API also plans additional bindings, e.g. async and message queues.

* The EWP Courses API [[EWP-COURSES]] defines an XML schema in which a list of courses should be returned.

* [[DEQAR]] and the Credential Registry each allow submission of data through manual entry, upload of a CSV file or use of a JSON-based REST API.

Key Concepts {#concepts}
============

The following key concepts and terminology are used throughout the document, as well as other QualityLink specifications:

<pre class=include>
path: concepts.include
</pre>
: <dfn>manifest file</dfn>
:: a file listing a [=data provider's=] data sources available for aggregation, as described in [[!QL-DISCO]]

User Stories {#user-stories}
============

The following usage scenarios illustrate ways in which this specification might be used or desired features it should enable:

Feed data {#uc-1}
---------

As a [HEI] I want to feed my data into a Europe-wide aggregator easily and flexibly, in order to avoid unnecessary burden.

Efficient aggregation {#uc-2}
---------------------

As a data aggregator I want to aggregate data from [HEIS] and other [=data providers=] efficiently, i.e. avoiding too much overhead or redundant data transfers.

Access control {#uc-3}
--------------

As a [=data provider=] I want to ensure that only specified [=aggregators=] (e.g. the QualityLink one) can harvest my data.

Requirements {#requirements}
============

- [=Data providers=] should be able to choose between several widely-used formats in which to provide their data.

- [=Data providers=] must be able to implement access control mechanisms so that only the QualityLink aggregator can harvest their data.

- There needs to be a mechanism to indicate whether data has changed since the last harvest/connection.

- The QualityLink [=aggregator=] should be able to harvest data from several sources of one [=data provider=], e.g. different faculties or sub-units of a [HEI]

Note: The current version specifies a pull strategy only, where the QualityLink aggregator periodically polls the available data sources. A push option might be realised later.

Methods {#methods}
=======

The following sections outline the available data transport methods and formats, as well as their specific requirements.

A [=data provider=] may choose one or several options in which to provide their data.

An [=aggregator=] should support all formats described.

None of the formats mandate the use of encrypted connections, i.e. HTTPS, necessarily. [=Data providers=] should, however, use HTTPS wherever possible; the use of HTTPS is ensured by providing `https://` URIs in the [=manifest file=].

Static ELM File {#elm}
---------------

Data on learning opportunities described in [[!ELM]] format can be serialised as:

- RDF/XML (`application/rdf+xml`)
- Turtle (`text/turtle`)
- JSON-LD (`application/ld+json`)

The data source must return the correct content type for the serialisation used.

### Required Fields ### {#elm-required}

The minimum required fields are defined by a set of [[!SHACL]] constraints, which are based on the [[!ELM]] Application Profile "Learning Opportunities and Qualifcations".

ELM data must comply with the requirements specified by the shape `http://data.quality-link.eu/ontology/v1#LearningOpportunity` [[!QL-ONT]].

### Incremental Transport ### {#elm-incremental}

[=Data providers=] should implement at least one of two options:

- Provide an accurate `Last-Modified` [[!RFC9110]] header in response to a HTTP `HEAD` request, indicating when the data was last changed/updated.

- Process the `If-Modified-Since` header if provided in a HTTP `HEAD` or `GET` request, return a `200` (OK) status code (and data in case of `GET`) only if modifications occured, and a `304` (Not Modified) status code otherwise. [[!RFC9110]]

[=Aggregators=] should harvest data sources less frequently if neither of the two options are implemented.

### Metadata ### {#elm-metadata}

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `elm`
path: a URL where the static file is hosted at
version: the ELM version used
</pre>

OOAPI {#ooapi}
-----

[=Education providers=] can expose data on their learning opportunities according to the Open Edcuation API specification [[!OOAPI]].

The [=aggregator=] may use the following endpoints to acquire data:

- `GET /education-specifications`
- `GET /education-specifications/{educationSpecificationId}`
- `GET /courses/{courseId}/offerings`
- `GET /courses/{courseId}/components`
- `GET /programs/{programId}/offerings`
- `GET /components/{componentId}/offerings`
- `GET /offerings/{offeringId}`

### Required Fields ### {#ooapi-required}

Per the OOAPI specification, the following fields are required:

- `primaryCode`
- `abbreviation`
- `name`
- `description`
- `teachingLanguage`
- `level` (for courses)
- `programType` (for programmes)

In addition, the following fields need to be present for the purposes of the QualityLink [=aggregator=] in order to align with ELM requirements:

- `fieldsOfStudy`
- `learningOutcomes`
- `levelOfQualification` (programme only)

### Incremental Transport ### {#ooapi-incremental}

While OOAPI does include the ability to query learning opportunities based on the year/semester in which they are offered, the standard does not include query parameters based on modification dates or similar.

Standard HTTP headers are, however, compatible with OOAPI and [=data providers=] should thus implement at least one of two options, at least for the `GET /education-specifications` endpoint:

- Provide an accurate `Last-Modified` [[!RFC9110]] header in response to a HTTP `HEAD` request, indicate when the data was last changed/updated.

- Process the `If-Modified-Since` [[!RFC9110]] header if provided in a HTTP request and only return data if modifications occured.

### Metadata ### {#ooapi-metadata}

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `ooapi`
path: the URL of the OOAPI root
version: the OOAPI version implemented
</pre>

Edu-API {#edu-api}
-------

[=Education providers=] can expose data on their learning opportunities using the Edu-API specification [[!Edu-API]], a RESTful API standard maintained by 1EdTech.
This method delivers JSON-formatted responses and supports real-time querying of educational data, such as courses and programs, making it suitable for dynamic aggregation scenarios.

The [=aggregator=] may use the following endpoints to acquire data (non-exhaustive list, based on Edu-API Core):

- `GET /courses` - Retrieve a list of courses.
- `GET /courses/{courseId}` - Retrieve details of a specific course.
- `GET /programs` - Retrieve a list of programs.
- `GET /programs/{programId}` - Retrieve details of a specific program.

Additional endpoints (e.g., for offerings or components) may be supported depending on the provider’s implementation.

### Required Fields ### {#edu-api-required}

The Edu-API specification defines a core set of fields for [=learning opportunities=], aligned with its *Learning Resource Core* profile. At a minimum, [=data providers=] must include:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the learning opportunity.
- `title`: Name or title of the course or program.
- `description`: Brief description of the learning opportunity.
- `type`: Type of learning opportunity (e.g., "Course", "Program").
- `primaryCode`:
- `level`:
- `gradingScheme`:
- `teachingLanguage` / `recordLanguage`: 

In addition, the fields `credits` and `learningOutcomes` are recommended to align with the European Learning Model [[!ELM]] and QualityLink goals. Providers should refer to
the Edu-API *Learning Resource Core* bindings for full details.

### Incremental Updates ### {#edu-api-incremental}

The [[!Edu-API]] specification includes a `dateLastModified` property in resource responses (e.g., for courses and programs), indicating the last modification date in ISO 8601 format.

This property enables tracking changes to individual resources and can be combined with the `filter` parameter on collections like `GET /courses` or `GET /programs` to support efficient aggregation, providing patterns for both initial bulk loads and delta updates, [=data providers=] and [=aggregators=] should follow this choreography where possible:

- **Initial or Bulk Load**: The [=aggregator=] makes a series of "get all" requests (e.g., `GET /courses`, `GET /programs`) to retrieve all resources needed, establishing a baseline dataset. The `dateLastModified` value for each resource should be recorded for subsequent delta updates.

- **Delta or True-Up**: The [=aggregator=] repeats the "get all" requests, ideally using a filter on `dateLastModified` (e.g., `GET /courses?modifiedAfter=2025-03-01T00:00:00Z`) to retrieve only resources modified since the last sync. If this filter is not supported, the [=aggregator=] must fetch the full collection and compare `dateLastModified` values locally against the last sync timestamp.

The QualityLink [=aggregator=] may use the `dateLastModified` value from previous responses to determine which resources have changed since the last harvest.

### Metadata ### {#edu-api-metadata}

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `edu-api`
path: The URL of the Edu-API root (e.g., `https://provider.example.edu/edu-api/v1/`)
version: The Edu-API version implemented (e.g., `1.0`)
</pre>

### Authentication with OAuth 2.0 ### {#edu-api-oauth}

Edu-API mandates the use of OAuth 2.0 for securing API endpoints, ensuring that only authorized [=aggregators=] (e.g., the QualityLink aggregator) can access protected data. [=Data providers=] must implement OAuth 2.0 as specified below.

OCCAPI {#occapi}
------

The [=aggregator=] may use the following endpoints to acquire data:

- `GET /hei/{heiId}`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/course`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/course/{courseId}`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/ounit`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/ounit/{ounitId}`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/ounit/{ounitId}/course`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/ounit/{ounitId}/programme`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/programme`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/programme/{programmeId}`
- `GET /hei/{heiId}/programme/{programmeId}/course`

OCCAPI makes use of hypermedia links to indicate which collection endpoints are available, scoped to [HEI] and optionally to organisational units and [=programme=] resources.

### Required fields ### {#occapi-required}

Data required in any resource type:

- `type`
- `id`

Data attributes required for [HEIS] and organisational units:

- `title`
- `heiId` or `ounitId` (for [HEIS] and organisational units respectively)

Data attributes required for both [=programme=] and [=course=] resources:

- `title`
- `code`
- `description`
- `ects`
- `iscedCode`
- `languageOfInstruction`

Data attributes required for [=programme=] resources only:

- `eqfLevelProvided`
- `length`

Data attributes required for [=course=] resources only:

- `description`
- `learningOutcomes`
- `academicTerm`

### Metadata ### {#occapi-metadata}

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `occapi`
path: The URL of the OCCAPI path for a given HEI<br>(e.g., `https://domain.tld/occapi/v1/hei/{heiId}`)
</pre>

EWP Courses API {#ewp}
---------------

Note: similar structure as for OOAPI

Access Control {#access-control}
==============

Currently all transport methods operate over HTTP. Hence the following access control strategies can all be used for either method.

A [=data provider=] may choose one of the strategies if they wish to control access to their data, but no access control is required.

An [=aggregator=] should support all formats described.

The exchange of access credentials or additional data that some of these options might require (e.g. certificates, trusted IPs, or client/secrets) is an out-of-band activity. The details of this are to be agreed between the [=aggregator=] and [=data providers=] during an onboarding/discovery process; the following sections describe in general terms what out-of-band communication is required.

Based on IP address {#access-control-ip}
-------------------

A [=data provider=] can limit access to certain ranges of IP addresses. To that end, [=aggregators=] should publish the IP address ranges from which their services may contact the exposed methods.

[=Data providers=] can omit the `auth` key from their [=manifest file=] or provide the following metadata for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `none`
</pre>

This mechanism does not require **out-of-band communication** beyond the [=aggregator=] publishing its IP address range.

Note: The QualityLink aggregator will publish the IP address range from which it operates.

HTTP Request Header {#access-control-header}
-------------------

The [=data provider=] may request that the [=aggregator=] include a specific HTTP header in all requests, e.g. a secret token.

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata under `auth` in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `httpheader`
</pre>

This mechanism requires **out-of-band communication** in which the [=data provider=] communicates a HTTP header field and the value to include to the [=aggregator=]. The modalities need to be specified by the [=aggregator=] separately from this specification.

OAuth 2.0 {#access-control-oauth}
------------------

A [=data provider=] may secure their endpoints using OAuth 2.0, requiring the [=aggregator=] to authenticate via an access token. This method is the standard authentication mechanism of [[!Edu-API]] (see [[#edu-api-oauth]]).

[=Data providers=] must implement OAuth 2.0 as follows:

- **Grant Type**: Support the *Client Credentials Grant* (per [[!RFC6749]], Section 4.4) for machine-to-machine authentication, suitable for aggregator access without user interaction.
- **Token Endpoint**: Provide a dedicated OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (e.g., `https://provider.example.edu/oauth/token`) where the [=aggregator=] can obtain an access token.
- **Scopes**: Define scopes to limit access (e.g. `http://purl.1edtech.org/spec/eduapi/v1p0/scope/core.readonly` for read-only access to [=learning opportunity=] data).

[=Data providers=] further should:

- Issue access tokens with a reasonable expiration time (e.g., 1 hour) and support refresh tokens.
- Validate tokens server-side per [[!RFC6750]] (Bearer Token Usage).

An [=aggregator=] must support the following:

- **Grant Type**: Support OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant as a minimum.
- **Credentials**: Obtain and securely store client credentials (`client_id` and `client_secret`) provided by the [=data provider=].
- **Access Token**: The [=aggregator=] must request and include a valid OAuth 2.0 Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of each request (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` per [[!RFC6750]]).
- Handle token expiration and renewal gracefully.

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata under `auth` in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `oauth2.0`
token_endpoint: URI of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint to use
</pre>

This method requires **out-of-band communication** in which the [=data provider=] supplied the [=aggregator=] with secret credentials, namely `client_id` and `client_secret` to be used when using the mechanism descibred in Section 2.3 of [[!RFC6749]].

HTTP Signature {#access-control-http-sig}
--------------

A [=data provider=] may request that the [=aggregator=] authenticates itself by signing all HTTP requests using HTTP Message Signatures according to [[!RFC9421]].

The [=aggregator=] must provide a signature that covers the `@authority` component as well as the following signature parameters (see Section 2.3 of [[!RFC9421]])):

- `created`: signature creation time (UNIX timestamp)
- `expires`: expiration time (UNIX timestamp), at most 1 hour after creation time
- `alg`: the signature algorithm
- `keyid`: the identifier for the key used (from the list published by the aggregator)
- `tag`: `qualitylink-v1` to identity the purpose

The [=aggregator=] must publish the following information in order to allow [=data providers=] to verify its signatures:

- A (list of) supported signature algorithm(s) (`alg`), including only algorithms based on asymmetric cryptography
- One public key per supported signature algorithm, together with a `keyid` that will be used

A [=data provider=] must support one of signature algorithm(s) supported by the [=aggregator=]. Unless it supports all algorithms, it needs to select the desired algorithm in the [=manifest file=].

The [=data provider=] should handle requests that are authenticated by a verified HTTP Message Signature, i.e. verify against the [=aggregator's=] public key, are applicable to the [=data provider=] based on the `@authority` component and are valid based on the `expires` parameter. If the [=data provider=] receives a request without a HTTP Message Signature, it should return a 401 (Unauthorized) response unless the request could be authenticated through another mechanism. If the request cannot be authenticated, the [=data provider=] should return a 403 (Forbidden) response. If the request contains corrupted or invalid `Signature` or `Signature-Input` headers, the [=data provider=] should return a 400 (Bad Request) response.

[=Data providers=] must provide the following metadata under `auth` in their [=manifest file=] for this method:

<pre class=simpledef>
type: `httpsig`
alg: one of the algorithms the aggregator supports (optional)
</pre>

This mechanism does not require **out-of-band communication** beyond the [=aggregator=] publishing the information mentioned above.

Security Considerations {#security}
=======================

The previous chapter describes how [=data providers=] can implement access control to their exposed data. The authors are aware that these mechanisms do not provide perfect security, e.g. IP addresses could be spoofed and HTTP Message Signatures could be replayed for a short amount of time if compromised.

This specification is, however, about exchange of data on [=learning opportunities=], which is generally meant to be public. The authors consider the described options reasonably secure for the purposes of limiting unauthorised harvesting of data.

[=Data providers=] should not expose any data through the methods described herein that is not meant to be public, especially no personal data.
